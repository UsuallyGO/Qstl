This source is implemented by Maxwell(nickname XiaoQ). Maxwell is one of the poorest programmer
in China or in the world(You would soon find this in his code). I write these code just for practice
to improve my poor coding skills.
As the source name you see, this is a Shanzhai(pirated) version for STL. But, it is much simpler
than STL(sure to be like this).
